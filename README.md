# linked_lists
The Odin Project's Linked Lists project in Ruby

# Assignment
Create a linked list in ruby

# Goal
Create the following methods:
1. #append(value) adds a new node containing value to the end of the list
2. #prepend(value) adds a new node containing value to the start of the list
3. #size returns the total number of nodes in the list
4. #head returns the first node in the list
5. #tail returns the last node in the list
6. #at(index) returns the node at the given index
7. #pop removes the last element from the list
8. #contains?(value) returns true if the passed in value is in the list and otherwise returns false.
9. #find(value) returns the index of the node containing value, or nil if not found.
10. #to_s represent your LinkedList objects as strings, so you can print them out and preview them in the console. The format should be: ( value ) -> ( value ) -> ( value ) -> nil
11. Extra Credit: #insert_at(value, index) that inserts a new node with the provided value at the given index.
12. Extra Credit: #remove_at(index) that removes the node at the given index.

# Expectations and challenges
1. Generally this will be interesting to try to wrap my head around the concept of linked lists and how this actually works in ruby.
2. It will probably take some further inspection and reading to get a proper feel for it.
3. Some of the methods above seem obvious, but I'm sure there will be some surprises along the way.
4. Somehow I feel like proper linking from one node to the next will take some getting used to.
